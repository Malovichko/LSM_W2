# LSM_Worker

## LSM_Worker extracts Leaf Surface Morphology from Laser Scanning Microscopy images

The plugin can work with multi-channel multi-frame 3D images in ***.lsm** format obtained from a laser scanning microscope. The main functionality of the plugin includes:
* Assembly and visualization of images.
*	Improve image quality (elimination of shear and overlap, application of the anisotropic diffusion algorithm).
*	Linear operations with intensity values from different channels.
*	Detection a 2D leaf surface.
*	Application of the segmentation algorithm for cellular and nuclear layers.
*	Manual correction of segmented regions.
*	Marking of cell groups.
*	Calculation of volumes for cells and nuclei.
*	Comparison of cells and nuclei by mutual arrangement.
*	Download images in tiff format for single-channel processing (multiple images for each channel can be downloaded).
*	Saving results in the form of tables and intermediate images, obtained at any stage of processing.
